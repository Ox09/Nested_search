# Search Component

A simple, lightweight search component built with **HTML**, **CSS (TailwindCSS)**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. This component offers an efficient way to explore nested datasets with advanced features like text highlighting and path-based searching.

## Features

- **Path-Based Searching**  
  Displays the complete hierarchical path of a searched keyword, providing context to the user.

- **Nested Path Display**  
  Dynamically shows the nested paths when a keyword is searched.

- **Text Highlighting**  
  Highlights the searched keywords within the text for better visibility.

## How It Works

1. **Search Input**:  
   The user enters a search term, and the component filters through the dataset recursively.

2. **Path-Based Results**:  
   Enables hierarchical path searching, showing the full route to the matching item.

3. **Text Highlighting**:  
   Optionally highlights the searched keyword in the results, controlled by a toggle switch.

4. **Nested Structure**:  
   Dynamically renders nested items in the dataset when a parent category is clicked.
